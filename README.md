# PCSCSample
Crossmatch Sentry sample smartcard reader application using the PCSC jni.

This is code from the Sentry Crendential SDK converted from Eclipse to
Android Studio.

This is a very basic application that enumerates the built-in smartcard
readers, lets the user select one and then displays some basic information
from a card if one is found on the reader.
